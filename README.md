Here’s a step-by-step overview of what I did:

3. Analyzing Keyword Growth
   
Using Google Trends, I tracked the popularity and growth trajectory of the selected keywords. This analysis helped me understand how these keywords perform over time and their potential to attract search traffic.

5. Understanding the Competition
   
I also conducted a competitive analysis to see how other players in the market are utilizing these keywords. This involved examining competitors’ strategies and how they rank for these terms. The insights from this analysis are documented in the attached Google Sheet.

To make the most of these keywords, I crafted 20 article titles for each keyword, totaling 360 titles. These titles are designed to address specific user needs and drive high-intent traffic to our Boilerplate product. They aim to solve problems and provide valuable content to users searching for these terms.
